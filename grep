vulkaninfo - Summarize Vulkan information in relation to the current environment.

USAGE: 
    vulkaninfo --summary
    vulkaninfo -o <filename> | --output <filename>
    vulkaninfo -j | -j=<gpu-number> | --json | --json=<gpu-number>
    vulkaninfo --text
    vulkaninfo --html
    vulkaninfo --show-formats
    vulkaninfo --show-tool-props
    vulkaninfo --show-promoted-structs

OPTIONS:
[-h, --help]         Print this help.
[--summary]          Show a summary of the instance and GPU's on a system.
[-o <filename>, --output <filename>]
                     Print output to a new file whose name is specified by filename.
                     File will be written to the current working directory.
[--text]             Produce a text version of vulkaninfo output to stdout. This is
                     the default output.
[--html]             Produce an html version of vulkaninfo output, saved as
                     "vulkaninfo.html" in the directory in which the command
                     is run.
[-j, --json]         Produce a json version of vulkaninfo output conforming to the Vulkan
                     Profiles schema, saved as 
                     "VP_VULKANINFO_[DEVICE_NAME]_[DRIVER_VERSION].json"
                     of the first gpu in the system.
[-j=<gpu-number>, --json=<gpu-number>]
                     For a multi-gpu system, a single gpu can be targeted by
                     specifying the gpu-number associated with the gpu of 
                     interest. This number can be determined by running
                     vulkaninfo without any options specified.
[--show-tool-props]  Show the active VkPhysicalDeviceToolPropertiesEXT that vulkaninfo finds.
[--show-formats]     Display the format properties of each physical device.
                     Note: This only affects text output.
[--show-promoted-structs] Include structs promoted to core in pNext Chains.
[--show-video-props]
                     Display the video profile info, video capabilities and
                     video format properties of each video profile supported
                     by each physical device.
                     Note: This only affects text output which by default
                     only contains the list of supported video profile names.
